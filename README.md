<h2 align="center">Supplementary</h2>
<p align="center">~ A mod adding bits and pieces here and there... ~</p>

### Overview
For now, Supplementary adds a few odds and ends: a few items, enchantments... you get the picture. At the end of 
the day, it's what its name implies - a supplement to the vanilla experience. But in the future, expect
it to bring more uses to more neglected parts of the game, as well as a somewhat cohesive magic system.
