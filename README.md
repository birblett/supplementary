### Overview
Supplementary is a vanilla+ mod making some relatively small additions (such as enchantments, items, cosmetics) to 
many parts of the game. For now, it doesn't make significant changes to the core gameplay loop, and as its name implies 
it serves mostly as a supplement to the vanilla experience.
